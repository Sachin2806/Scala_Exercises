Dataset is a a distributed collection of data. It is a strongly-typed object dictated by a case class you define or specify. It provides an API to transform domain objects or perform regular or aggregated functions. In our script below, we create a dataset of lines from a file. We make action call to count the number of lines and to retrive the first line. We transform the dataset with filter to another dataset of lines that containing the word “Spark”.
